The moving average crossover is when the price of an asset moves from one side 
of a moving average to the other. This crossover represents a change in momentum
 and can be used as a point of making the decision to enter or exit the market.

The dual moving average crossover occurs when a short-term average crosses a 
long-term average. This signal is used to identify that momentum is shifting in
the direction of the short-term average. 
A buy signal is generated when the short-term average crosses the long-term 
average and rises above it, while a sell signal is triggered by a 
short-term average crossing long-term average and falling below it.

Turtle trading is a popular trend following strategy that was initially 
taught by Richard Dennis. The basic strategy is to buy futures on a 
20-day high and sell on a 20-day low.

Reversion Strategy
The movement of a quantity will eventrually reverse. 

mean reversion strategy
Where stocks will return to their mean and you can take advantage of them
once they are there

Pairs Trading mean reversion
If two stocks have a high correlation that change in the differnce in price between
the two stocks can show a trading event

Simple Trading algo
Moving avergage crossover
create two separate Simple Moving Averages (SMA) of a time series with 
differing lookback periods, letâ€™s say, 40 days and 100 days. 

If the short moving average exceeds the long moving average then you go long,
if the long moving average exceeds the short moving average then you exit.
Long = buy
short = sell
